approch	
The redial zoning of the science center done in such a manner that all the functions are easily connected. We have to also include kamatibaug planatorium into scince center, so that bridge is provided which opens in exhibition pavilion.

Whole zoning converted into 3 layer which act as introvert and extrovert to the context. There is passage between  main core function layer which provide easy interaction. Due to the redial organization of built mass orientation it helps that each blocks can catch maxim mum wind, ventilation and light.

The site has river on two sides on which i devlope riverfront with the verious science activity.
